\verse{Who'll be the lady, who will be the lord
When we are ruled by the love of one another,
Who'll be the lady, who will be the lord
In the life that is coming in the morning.}

\chorus{And it's sing, John Ball and tell it to them all,
Long live the day that is dawning,
I'll crow like a cock, I'll carol like a lark
For the life that is coming in the morning.}

\verse{Eve is the lady, Adam is the lord
When we are ruled by the love of one another,
Eve is the lady, Adam is the lord
In the life that is coming in the morning.}

\verse{All shall be ruled by fellowship I say
All shall be ruled by the love of one another,
All shall be ruled by fellowship I say
In the life that is coming in the morning.}

\verse{Labour and spin for fellowship I say
Labour and spin for the love of one another,
Labour and spin for fellowship I say
And the life that is coming in the morning.}
