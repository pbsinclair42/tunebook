\verse{Oh the night was cold and the fridge was bare
And our Euro all but spent.
Ah but David said, ``Do not despair"
And to Tesco's thus, he duly went.
And when he returned, oh he looked so proud
With his valiant haul of meat.
Ah but we said, ``Dave, we are so few,
It's more than we could hope to eat."}

\chorus{Knowing me, knowing you,
Aha, aha.
Knowing me, knowing you,
Aha, aha.}

\verse{In a small town pub, you may meet a man
By the name of DJ Mo,
And the wisdom he may seek to impart
Is more than you may wish to know.
And looking back on that night we had
And our midnight meat party,
The words that remain, still lodged in my brain,
Are the words that DJ Mo would say.}
