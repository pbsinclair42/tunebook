\chorus{If I were a blackbird, I'd whistle and sing,
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in,
And on the top riggings, I'd there build my nest,
And lay there all night on his lily white breast.}

\verse{When I was a young girl my fortune was sad,
I once went a'courting a true sailor lad.
I courted him dearly, by night and by day,
And now for a sailor he's gone far away.}

\verse{My love's tall and handsome in every degree;
His parents despise him because he loves me.
And though they despise him, and say what they may
With breath in my body I'll love him always.}

\verse{He promised to meet me at Bonnybrook Fair
And buy me blue ribbons to tie in my hair,
And if I should meet him, I'd crown him with joy
And kiss the sweet lips of my true sailor boy.}

\verse{If I were a scholar, could handle my pen,
Just one private letter to him I would send.
I'd write and I'd tell him of my grief and woe
And far o'er the ocean to him I would go.}
