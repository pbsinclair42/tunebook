\verse{I'm going up the road now,
I'm going to the shop,
I'm gonna buy some Viscounts
And you can't make me stop.
I don't care how fat I get,
I'll eat what I please,
Cause when I get back home now
There'll be tea and toast and cheese!}

\chorus{Doo doo doodoo doo,
Doo doodoo doodoo doo,
Doo doodoo doo doodoo doo doo doo.
Doo doo doodoo doo,
Doo doodoo doodoo doo,
Doo doodoo doo doodoo doo doo doo.}

\verse{We're gonna start a tune now,
And it probably will be Hoy.
Everyone will shake their heads,
but Bob will say ``Oh boy!"
We're playing Wizard's Walk now,
It drives us round the bend,
High Drive's round the corner,
When will it fucking end!}

\verse{We're in the Angler's Haven,
The fire's fully stocked,
Patsy's in control now,
So the tunes will never stop!
The cuckoo waits for no man
But is guaranteed to please.
Paul is in the kitchen,
Making Weetabix and cheese.}
