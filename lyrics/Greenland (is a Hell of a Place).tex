\chorus{Greenland is a hell of a place,
It's a place that's never green,
Where there's ice and there's snow, and the whale fishes blow,
And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys,
The daylight's seldom seen.}

\verse{In eighteen hundred and sixty-four,
On June the thirteenth day,
Our gallant ship her anchor weighed,
And for Greenland sailed away, brave boys,
For Greenland sailed away.}

\verse{Our captain stood on the quarter deck,
With a spy glass in his hand.
``There's a whale, there's a whale, there's a bloody great whale,
And she blows on every span, brave boys,
She blows on every span".}

\verse{We hit that whale and the line paid out,
And she made a flounder with her tail,
And the boat capsized and ten men were drowned,
And we ne'er did catch that whale, brave boys,
We ne'er did catch that whale.}

\verse{Well, the losing of those ten brave men,
It grieves my heart full sore.
But the losing of that bloody great whale,
It grieves me ten times more, brave boys,
It grieves me ten times more.}
