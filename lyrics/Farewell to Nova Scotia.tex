\chorus{Farewell to Nova Scotia, the sea-bound coast,
Let your mountains dark and dreary be.
For when I'm far away on the briny ocean tossed,
Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?}

\verse{The sun was setting in the west,
The birds they sang on every tree.
All nature seemed inclined for to rest
But still there was no rest for me.}

\verse{I grieve to leave my native land,
I grieve to leave my comrades all,
And my parents whom I love so dear,
And the bonnie, bonnie lass that I do adore.}

\verse{The drums they do beat and the wars do alarm,
My captain calls, I must obey.
So farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia's charms,
For it's early in the morning and I'm far, far away.}

\verse{I have three brothers who are at rest,
Their arms are folded on their breasts.
But a poor simple sailor just like me,
Must be tossed and driven in the deep, dark sea.}
