\verse{The train it keeps on going but it's slowing down again,
And I've been on this train since just past half past ten.
We're bound for Georgemas Junction and time keeps dragging on,
But that train keeps on slowing: another crossing gone.}

\verse{When we were back in Golspie, the conductor told me ``Son,
The traffic signals at the level crossings are all done,
And it's five miles an hour that we have to crawl
Through every level crossing: 1-3-6 in all."}

\verse{I bet there's Wick folk smirking at the passing dining cart.
They get their freebie coffees but from from their plans need not depart.
To Thurso I was going but it's not to be:
We're being dropped at Georgemas Junction and then bussed to sea.}

\verse{If they'd gone on `til Thurso with the Scotrail train on time.
I'd be in Scrabster early at the Popeye Inn I'd dine,
But I'm bound for Georgmas Junction so it's not to be,
As the train keeps on slowing and Georgemas beckons me.}
