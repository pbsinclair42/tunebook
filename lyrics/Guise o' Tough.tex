\verse{Now I gaed up tae Alford fir tae get a fee,
And I fell in wi' Jamie Broon and wi' him did agree.}

\chorus{Tum ma hi tum do, ma hi tum day,
A hi tum ma diddle tum ma hi tum day}

\verse{I engaged wi' Jamie Broon in the year o' ninety-one,
Tae gang hame an' ca' his second pair an' be his orraman.}

\verse{When I gaed hame tae Guise o' Tough 'twas on an evening clear,
An' oot aboot some orra hoose the gaffer did appear.}

\verse{I'm the maister o' this place an' that's the mistress there,
An' ye'll get plenty cheese an' breid an' plenty mair tae spare.}

\verse{I sat an' ate at cheese an' breid till they did roon' me stare,
An' then I thocht that it wis time tae gang an' see my pair.}

\verse{I gaed tae the stable my pairie fir tae view,
An' aye they were a dandy pair a chestnut and a blue.}

\verse{On the followin' mornin' I gaed tae the ploo,
But lang lang ower lowsin' time my pairie gart me rue.}

\verse{My ploo she wisna workin' weel she widna throw the fur,
The gaffer says a better yin at the smiddy tae gang fir.}

\verse{When I got hame the new ploo she pleased me unco weel,
But I thought she wid be better gin she had a cuttin' wheel.}

\verse{I wrocht awa' a month or twa wi' unco little clatter,
Till I played up some nasty tricks and broke the tattie chapper.}

\verse{The gaffer he got word o' this and orders did lay doon,
That if I did the like again he wad pit me frae the toon.}

\verse{Noo my song is nearly ended and I won't sing any more,
An' if be offended ye can walk ootside the door.}
