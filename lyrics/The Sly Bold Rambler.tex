\verse{Young Guy Fawkes in old York town,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
Never had a father `round,
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
Since King James, with horse and hound
Did spill his blood upon the ground.}

\chorus{So stoke the fire,
Build it higher,
For the sly bold rambler.}

\verse{Such for James was his disdain,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
Off he went to fight for Spain.
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
He slew the English east and west
But to kill their king he wanted best.}

\verse{Five years shy of sixteen-ten,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
He formed a band of merry men.
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
To slay the king, as was their bent,
They'd blow away the parliament!}

\verse{On November's half-tenth day,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
In the cellar Fawkes did stay,
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
Guarding barrels, for to light
When down came the guard in the dead of night.}

\verse{Though he was of Scots descent,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
To hide the fact was his intent,
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
So he said it was his plan
To blow the king to his native land.}

\verse{Sixth November he did flee.
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
Though he was under lock and key,
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
Escape from cells designed for men
Is not beyond a fox's ken.}

\verse{They could not admit he'd fled,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
Or the guards would lose their heads,
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
And the thought they did so dread
That they killed another in his stead.}

\verse{Old King James called for f\^{e}te,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
And the bonfires all were lit.
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
In the flames Guy Fawkes did go,
But not the real one, don't you know!}

\verse{And his years were long and many,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
At a manse near Auchendinny.
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
Still he lives there, so they say
Though old King James has passed away.}

\verse{Listen, children, unto me,
\textit{Coat of red and teeth of white,}
As you burn Guy's effigy.
\textit{With eyes as bright as amber,}
Chase your dreams on widespread wings
And never fear the wrath of kings.}
