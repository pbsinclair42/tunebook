\chorus{Hang me, oh hang me,
I'll be dead and gone.
Hang me, oh hang me,
I'll be dead and gone.
I wouldn't mind the hanging,
But the layin' in the grave so long, poor boy,
I've been all around this world.}

\verse{I been all `round Cape Girardeau,
Parts of Arkansas.
All around Cape Girardeau,
Parts of Arkansas.
Got so goddamn hungry,
I could hide behind a straw, poor boy,
Been all around this world.}

\verse{Went up on a mountain,
There I made my stand.
Went up on a mountain,
There I made my stand.
Rifle on my shoulder,
And a dagger in my hand, poor boy,
Been all around this world.}

\verse{Put the rope around my neck
And hung me up so high.
Put the rope around my neck
And hung me up so high.
Last words I heard `em say:
``Won't be long now `fore you die, poor boy",
Been all around this world.}
