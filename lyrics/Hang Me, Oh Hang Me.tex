\verse{Hang me, oh hang me,
I'll be dead and gone.
Hang me, oh hang me,
I'll be dead and gone.
I wouldn't mind the hanging,
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy,
Been all around this world.}

Parts of Arkansas.
All around Cape Girardeau,
Parts of Arkansas.
Got so god damn hungry,
I could hide behind a straw, poor boy,
Been all around this world.}

\verse{Went up on a mountain,
There I made my stand.
Went up on a mountain,
There I made my stand.
Rifle on my shoulder,
And a dagger in my hand, poor boy,
Been all around this world.}

\verse{Put the rope around my neck
And hung me up so high.
Put the rope around my neck
And hung me up so high.
Last words I heard 'em say:
"Won't be long now 'fore you die, poor boy",
Been all around this world.}

\verse{So hang me, oh hang me,
I'll be dead and gone.
Hang me, oh hang me,
I'll be dead and gone.
I wouldn't mind the hanging,
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy,
Been all around this world.}
