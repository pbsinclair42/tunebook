\verse{Well if I was a sinner,
I tell you what I'd do,
I'd give up all my sinning
and I'd work on a building too.}

\chorus{I'm working on a building,
I'm working on a building,
I'm working on a building for my Lord, 
For my Lord.
It's a holy ghost building,
It's a holy ghost building,
It's a holy ghost building for my Lord,
For my Lord.}

\verse{Well if I was a gambler,
I tell you what I'd do,
I'd give up all my gambling
and I'd work on a building too.}

\verse{Well if I was a drunkard,
I tell you what I'd do,
I'd give up all my drinking
and I'd work on a building too.}

\verse{But if I was a preacher,
I tell you what I'd do,
I'd keep right on preaching
and I'd work on a building too.}
