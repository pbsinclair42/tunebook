\verse{When I was a young lad I used to like girls,
I'd fondle their bodies and play with their curls,
But my girlfriend ran off with my ex-best friend Bruce,
And you'd never get treatment like that from a moose.}

\chorus{So it's moose, moose, I like a moose.
I've never had anything quite like a moose.
I've had many lovers, my morals are loose,
But I've never had anything quite like a moose.}

\verse{So when I'm in the need for a really great lay,
I go to my bedroom and get me some hay,
I open the window and spread it around,
For a moose always comes when there's hay on the ground.}
 
\verse{Now gorillas are fine for a Saturday night,
And lions and tigers put up a good fight,
But it just ain't the same when you slam that caboose
As the feeling you gets when you're humping a moose.}

\verse{When I am an old man, advanced in my years,
I'll look back on my life and I'll shed me no tears,
I'll sit in my chair with a glass of vermouth,
Playing hide the salami with my favourite moose.}

\verse{I've died, gone to Heaven, my soul flees away,
I show up at those gates with a bale of hay,
St. Pete's bound to inquire as to my wicked grin,
So I'll wind up in Hell fucking mooses again.}
