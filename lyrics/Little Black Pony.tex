\verse{When I was a boy I had no time,
No time for ceremonies,
All I wanted was to see the world
From the back of a little black pony,
From the back of a little black pony.}

\verse{Mr. Lee lived across the street,
Had a daughter my age named Joanie.
In the summertime we'd build us a boat,
We'd sail to the island Coney,
We'd sail to the island Coney}.

\verse{There used to be a medicine man come around,
Everybody called him a phony,
But I thought he was a king when I heard him ring
A big bell on the little black pony,
He was riding on a little black pony.}

\verse{I said ``Oh mister what can I give you,
I haven't got much money,
But I'll do anything even try to sing
If you'll let me have that pony,
I gotta have that little black pony.''}

\verse{He said ``Son, learn to play the banjo,
All the old tunes happy and lonely,
And I'll be back this way someday,
And you can have that pony,
You can have that little black pony.''}

\verse{Well the old man he never came back,
But I never once thought he was a phony,
I just guess he must have realized,
He couldn't do without that pony,
He couldn't live without that little black pony.}

\verse{Mr. Lee moved away and got a job in the city,
That's the last I saw of Joanie,
But I can't forget the cardboard boats,
And I still love little black ponies,
I still love little black ponies.}
