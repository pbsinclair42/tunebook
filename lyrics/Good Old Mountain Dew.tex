\verse{My brother Bill runs a still on the hill 
Where he turns out a gallon or two.
The buzzards in the sky get so drunk they can't fly
Just from sniffing that old mountain dew.}

\chorus{Well they call it that good old mountain dew,
And them that refuse it are few. 
I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug 
With that good old mountain dew.}

\verse{My uncle Mort, he is sawed off and short, 
He measure `bout four foot two, 
But he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint 
Of that good old mountain dew.}

\verse{The preacher walked by, with a tear in his eye 
Said that his wife had the flu 
And hadn't I ought just to give him a quart 
Of that good old mountain dew.}

\verse{There's an old hollow tree, just a little way from me 
Where you lay down a dollar or two.
If you hush up your mug, then they'll give you a jug
Of that good old mountain dew.}

\verse{Mr. Franklin Roosevelt, he told me how he felt 
The day the old dry law went through: 
If your likker's too red, it will swell up your head 
Better stick to that good old mountain dew.}
