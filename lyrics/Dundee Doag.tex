\chorus{I'm a doag, I'm a doag, I'm a Dundee doag,
I'm a D, O, A, G, doag. 
I'm fightin' mad and a heidcase,
and I live up the Lochee road
All the doags in the toon have heard o' me,
They call me mental Wull,
I killed every cat for miles aroond,
I'm lookin' for Sam the Skull. }

\verse{There's a great big doag called Gnasher Bob
Wha lives here in Dundee,
Thought he was a hard man,
He was going tae challenge me.
Well I telt him it was suicide,
But still he widnae listen,
He's gaein' about on three legs noo,
And half his tackle's missin'.}

\verse{I've a heid like an alligator,
And teeth like a dinosaur,
I'm fifteen stone wi' ma claes off,
Wi' feet like a tiger's paw.
They pit bulls and Alsatians,
They stay oot o' my way,
Rottweilers dinnae bother me,
Cos I eat one every day.}

\verse{Last week I gaed tae Shettleston
Tae seek oot Sam the Skull,
They say he's moved and he's livin' wi' a bird
In a single end in Maryhill.
I phoned him on his mobile,
Said you and a' your team
If ye've balls to show, then we'll have a square go
In the middle of the Glasgae Green.}

\verse{Next morning at the break o' dawn
Stood Sam and a' his team,
Just like the old O.K. Corral
In the middle of the Glasgae Green,
He came at me like a charging bull,
Said "You're just a mug",
He tried to tear ma een oot, 
so I cut off half his lug.}

\verse{He hit me wi' a baseball bat
That had a six inch nail,
He kneed me in the goolies,
so I bit off half his tail.
We kicked and bit and kicked and scratched,
For sixteen hours and mair,
The whiskers, blood and fur and guts,
Was fleein' everywhere.}

\verse{We twa were feelin' knackered,
And so we did agree,
If I'd bide oot of Glasgae,
Then he'd stay oot Dundee.
We put awa' oor weapons,
We shook each other's paws.
Naebody won the fight that day,
We just called it a draw.}
