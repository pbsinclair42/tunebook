\chorus{Poor Ned, you're better off dead,
At least you'll get some peace of mind.
You're out on the track,
They're right on your back,
Boy they're gonna hang you high.}

\verse{Eighteen hundred and seventy eight
Was the year I remember so well.
They put my father in an early grave,
Slung my mother in gaol.
Now I don't know what's right or wrong,
But they hung Christ on nails.
Six kids at home and two still on the breast,
They wouldn't even give her bail.}

\verse{You know I wrote a letter about Stringy-Bark Creek
So they would understand
That I might be a bushranger
But I'm not a murdering man.
I didn't want to shoot Kennedy
Or that copper Lonnigan.
He alone could have saved his life
By throwing down his gun.}

\verse{You know they took Ned Kelly
And they hung him in the Melbourne jail.
He fought so very bravely
Dressed in iron mail,
And no man single-handed
Can hope to break the bars.
It's a thousand like Ned Kelly
Who'll hoist the flag of stars.}
