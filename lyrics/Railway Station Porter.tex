\verse{Oh I am a railway porter and ma name is Willie Lee, 
I'm the most important person that you're ever like tae see.
I'm in charge of a' the stations frae Dumbarton tae Dundee, 
And my duty is tae tell ye where ye change for.}

\chorus{Ye change for Auchtermuchty, Tilly or Tuchty, Crieff or Cullercoats, 
Fife or John o' Groats, Beecham's Pills or Quaker Oats. 
Change for Ecclefechan, Aiberdeen and a' the stations in between 
Unless ye want tae gang tae Tobermory.}

\verse{Ye should see me hurl ma barrow, ye should see me sweep the flair, 
If there's no a tip forthcoming ye should hear me curse and swear, 
When a train comes in the station, ma heid flees in the air, 
And I cry wi' a' ma might ``Ye've got tae change here."}

\verse{Well, one day the Royal Train drew in, ma heart was full of pride, 
I keeked in through the windae, and wha d'ye think I spied?
Her Majesty the Queen herself, the Duke was sittin' by her side,
So I cried, wi' a' ma might ``Ye've got tae change here."}
