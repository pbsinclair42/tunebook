\verse{Now Bass Strait roars like some great millrace
\textit{And where are you, my Annie?}
And the same moon shines on this lonely place
As shone one day on my Annie's face.}

\chorus{But Annie dear, don't wait for me.
I fear I shall not return to thee.
There's naught to do but endure my fate,
And watch the moon, the lonely moon,
Light the breakers on wild Bass Strait.}

\verse{We stole a vessel and all her gear
\textit{And where are you, my Annie?}
And from Van Diemen's we north did steer
Till Bass Strait's wild waves wrecked us here.}

\verse{And somewhere west Port Melbourne lies
\textit{And where are you, my Annie?}
Through swamps infested with snakes and flies.
The fool who walks there, he surely dies.}

\verse{We hail no ships, though the time it drags.
\textit{And where are you, my Annie?}
Our chain-gang walk and our government rags
All mark us out as Van Diemen's lags.}

\verse{We fled the lash and the chafing chain.
\textit{And where are you, my Annie?}
We fled hard labour and brutal pain,
And here we are and here remain.}
