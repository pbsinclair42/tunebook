\verse{``Oh tell me whit was on yer road, ye roarin' Norland wind?
As ye came blawin' frae the land that's never frae ma mind.
Ma feet they travel England but I'm deein' for the North."
``Ma man, I saw the siller tides run up the Firth o' Forth."}

\verse{``Aye wind, I ken them weel enough an' fine they fa' and rise,
And fain I'd feel the creepin' mist on yonder shore that lies.
But tell me as ye pass them by, whit saw ye on the way?"
``Ma man, I rocked the rovin' gulls that sail abin the Tay."}
 
\verse{``But saw ye nothin', leein' wind, afore ye came tae Fife?
For there's muckle lyin' `yont the Tay that's mair tae me nor life."
``Ma man, I swept the Angus braes that ye havnae trod for years."
``Oh wind, forgie a hameless loon that cannae see for tears."}

\verse{``And far abin the Angus straths I saw the wild geese flee,
A lang, lang skein o' beatin' wings wi' their heids toward the sea,
And aye their cryin' voices trailed ahint them on the air."
``Oh wind, hae mercy, haud your wheesht for I daurna listen mair."}
