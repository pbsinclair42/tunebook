\chorus{Oh, the prickle-eye bush
That pricks my heart full sore,
And if ever I get out of this prickle-eye bush
Then I never will get in it any more.}

\verse{Oh hangman, stay your hand,
Stay it for a while,
For I think I see my sister
Coming over yonder stile.
Oh sister, have you brought me gold?
Or silver to set me free?
For to save my body from the cold, cold ground
And my neck from the gallows tree.
Oh no, I have not brought you gold
Or silver to set you free
For to save your body from the cold, cold ground
And your neck from the gallows tree.}

\verse{Oh hangman, stay your hand,
Stay it for a while,
For I think I see my mother
Coming over yonder stile.
Oh mother, have you brought me gold?
Or silver to set me free?
For to save my body from the cold, cold ground
And my neck from the gallows tree.
Oh no, I have not brought you gold
Or silver to set you free
For to save your body from the cold, cold ground
And your neck from the gallows tree.}

\verse{Oh hangman, stay your hand,
Stay it for a while,
For I think I see my lover
Coming over yonder stile.
Oh love, have you brought me gold?
Or silver to set me free?
For to save my body from the cold, cold ground
And my neck from the gallows tree.
Oh yes, I have brought you gold
And silver to set you free
For to save your body from the cold, cold ground
And your neck from the gallows tree.}

\chorus{Oh, the prickle-eye bush
That pricks my heart full sore,
And now that I'm out of this prickle-eye bush
Now I never will get in it any more.}
