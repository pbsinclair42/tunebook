\verse{Wor Geordey and Bob Jonsin, both laying in one bed,
In a little lodging hoose that's doon the shore.
Before he'd been an hour asleep, a kick frae Geordey's foot
Made Bob waken up to roar instead o' snore.}

\chorus{Keep your feet still Geordey hinny, let's be happy for the night,
For I might not be so happy through the day,
So give us this bit comfort, keep your feet still, Geordey lad,
And dinnae send ma bonnie dreams away.}

\verse{I dreamt there was a dancing held, and Mary Clark was there;
And though we tript it lightly on the floor,
And I pressed her heavin' breast tae mine when waltzin' roond the room,
That's mair than I have ever done before.}

\verse{Ye'll know the lad she gans with, they call him Jimmy Green,
I thought he tried tae spoil us of oor fun,
But I dreamt I nailed him heavy, and blacked the fella's eyes;
If I'd slept it's hard to tell what I'd hae done.}

\verse{I thought I set her hame that night, content we went along.
I kissed her lips a hundred times or mair,
And I wished the road would never end, so happy like was I,
I could walk a thousand miles wi' Mary there.}

\verse{I dreamt Jim Green had left the toon an' left his love tae me,
And I thought the hoose was furnished wi' the best,
And I dreamt I just had left the church wi' Mary be ma side,
When your clumsy feet completely spoiled the rest.}
