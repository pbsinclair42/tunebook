\verse{Come all you gallant sailors bold, all you who march to drum,
Let's go and look for Captain Ward, far out on the seas he roams.
For he is the biggest robber that ever you did hear
And there has not been such a robber found in above this hundred year.}

\chorus{The wind blows high and the wind blows low
All on the raging sea.}

\verse{A ship was sailing from the east and going to the west,
All loaded with silks and satins fine and velvets of the best.
But in meeting there with Captain Ward, it was a sad meeting
For he robbed us of our wealth and their store and bid us tell our king.}

\verse{So our king then he has built him a ship of noted fame,
She's called the Royal Rainbow if you would know her name.
She was as well provided for as any ship can be,
With thirteen hundred sailors bold to bear her company.}

\verse{And at six o'clock in the morning how they did begin to fight
And so they did continue there till eight o'clock at night.
``Fight on, fight on!" says Captain Ward, ``For this sport pleases me.
Although you fight a month or more, your master still I'll be!"}

\verse{And then the Royal Rainbow fired but she fired all in vain,
Until three hundred sailors bold all on the ship lay slain.
``Go home, go home!" says Captain Ward, ``And tell your king from me:
Although he's king of all dry land yet I'm king of the sea!"}
