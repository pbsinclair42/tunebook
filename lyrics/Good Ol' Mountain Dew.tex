\verse{There's an old hollow tree, down the road here from me,
Where you put in a dollar or two.
If you go `round the bend, when you come back again
Why it's full of that good ol' mountain dew.}

\chorus{Well they call it that good ol' mountain dew,
And them that refuse it are few. 
I'll hush up my mug if you fill up my jug 
With that good ol' mountain dew.}

\verse{My brother Bill has an old copper still,
Where he turns out a gallon or two.
And them buzzards on high, why they can't hardly fly
From a' smellin' that ol' mountain dew.}

\verse{My uncle Mort all is sawed off and short, 
He stands only 4 foot 2,
But he feels like a giant when you give him a pint 
Of that good ol' mountain dew!}

\verse{The preacher come by, with his head hoisted high,
He told me his wife had the flu.
So he said that I ought just to give him a quart 
Of that good ol' mountain dew.}

\verse{Mr. Franklin Roosevelt, he told me how he felt 
The day the old dry law went through: 
If your likker's too red, it will swell up your head 
Better stick to that good ol' mountain dew.}
