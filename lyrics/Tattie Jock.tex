\verse{Ye'll a' hae heard o' Tattie Jock,
Likewise o' Mutton Peggie.
They had a fairmie up in Fife,
An' the name o' it was Craigie.}

\chorus{Singin' ah riddle aye,
Roo dum di do,
Ah riddle aye,
Roo dum day.}

\verse{There was ten pair upon that place,
Likewise ten able men.
It's five they gaed for tae kinnle the fire,
An' the ither five oot tae scran.}

\verse{Three month we served wi' Tattie Jock,
An' weel we did agree,
Till we found oot that the tattie shed
Could be open by the bothie key.}

\verse{We a' went intae the tattie shed,
Oor bags were hardly full,
When Tattie Jock in ahint the door
Cried ``Aye ma lads stand still".}

\verse{Oh the first he got was Willie Marr,
The next was Sandy Doo,
There was Jimmy Grey and Wull Moncur,
An' Jimmy Pethrie flew.}

\verse{Next day some o' us were drivin' dung
An' some were at the mill.
The foreman he was at the ploo'
Upon Pitlootie Hill.}

\verse{They sent for ten big polismen
But nine there only came.
It dinged them for tae lift's that night
Us bein' ten able men.}

\verse{The hin'maist lad was the wisest een,
The best lad o' us a'.
He jined a man o' war at Leith
So's he didnae need tae stand the law.}

\verse{When we were gettin' oor sentences
We a' stood roond an' roond,
But when we heard o' the fourteen years
Oor tears cam' rollin' doon.}

\verse{When Tattie Jock heard tell o' this
He cried and grat fu' sore.
A thousand guineas he would pay
If that would clear oor score.}

\verse{A bag o' gold he did produce
Tae pey it there and then,
But the lawyer only told him money
Wouldna clear his men.}

\verse{An' when they mairched us up through Perth
We heard the news boy say,
``It's hard tae see sic able men
Rade aff tae Botany Bay".}

\verse{When we arrive in Botany Bay,
Some letters we will send
Tae tell oor friends the hardships we
Endure in a foreign land.}
