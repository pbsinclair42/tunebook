\verse{Wish that I was up on Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills.
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top,
Ain't no telephone bills.
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top,
Half bear, the other half cat,
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop,
I still dream about that.}

\chorus{Oh, Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me.
Good ol' Rocky Top (Good ol' Rocky Top),
Rocky Top, Tennessee,
Rocky Top, Tennessee.}

\verse{Once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Looking for a moonshine still.
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top,
Reckon they never will.
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top,
Dirt's too rocky by far.
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar.}

\verse{They've got black bears up on Rocky Top,
Coyotes, possums and bats,
But ain't no lawyers up on Rocky Top,
Ain't no bureaucrats.
I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen.
All I know is it's a pity life
Can't be simple again.}
