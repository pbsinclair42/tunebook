\verse{In Frisco Bay there were three ships,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
In Frisco Bay there were three ships,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{And one of them was Noah's old ark,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
Covered all o'er with a'hickory bark,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{Noah took animals, two of each kind,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
The great big stag and his heathery hind,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{Now the cat bit the rat with a howl and a yowl,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
And the bull and the cow they started to row,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{``Ah now," said Noah with a flick of his whip,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
``Stop this row or you'll scuttle the ship",
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{But the bull struck his horn through the side of the ark,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
And the little black dog he started to bark,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{So Noah took the dog, shoved his nose up the hole,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
And ever since then dogs' nose has been cold,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{It's a long long time and a very long time,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
A long long time and a very long time,
\textit{A long time ago.}}
