\verse{In Frisco Bay there were three ships,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
In Frisco Bay there were three ships,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{And one of them was Noah's old ark,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
All covered all o'er wi' hickory bark,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{They took two animals of every kind,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
They took two animals of every kind,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{The bull and the cow they started for to row,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
The bull and the cow they started for to row,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{Then said old Noah with a flick of his whip,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
``Come stop this row or I'll scuttle the ship",
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{But the bull struck his arm through the side of the ark,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
And the little black dog he started to bark,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{So Noah took the dog, shoved his nose up the hole,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
And ever since then dogs' nose has been cold,
\textit{A long time ago.}}

\verse{It's a long long time and a very long time,
\textit{Singing way, hey, hey oh.}
A long long time and a very long time,
\textit{A long time ago.}}
