\verse{Now bold Sir Rylas a-hunting went,
\textit{All along and down alee.}
And bold Sir Rylas a-hunting went,
\textit{Down by the riverside.}
Now bold Sir Rylas a-hunting went,
To catch some game was his intent,}

\chorus{Down in the grove where the wild flowers grow
And the green leaves fall all around.}

\verse{He spied a wild woman sitting in a tree,
\textit{All along and down alee.}
``Good lord, what brings you here?" said she,
\textit{Down by the riverside.}
``Oh, there's a wild boar in this wood;
He'll eat your flesh and drink your blood."}

\verse{He put his horn unto his mouth,
\textit{All along and down alee.}
And blew it east, north, west and south.
\textit{Down by the riverside.}
The wild boar came out of his den,
Bringing his children nine or ten.}

\verse{Then bold Sir Rylas the wild boar fell on,
\textit{All along and down alee.}
And bold Sir Rylas the wild boar fell on.
\textit{Down by the riverside.}
He fought him three hours all the day
Until the boar would have run away.}

\verse{``Oh, now you've killed my spotted pig,
\textit{All along and down alee.}
Oh, now you've killed my spotted pig,
\textit{Down by the riverside.}
Oh, there's three things I'd have of thee,
Your horse and your hound and your fair lady."}

\verse{``Oh, now I've killed your spotted pig,
\textit{All along and down alee.}
Oh, now I've killed your spotted pig,
\textit{Down by the riverside.}
Oh, there's no thing you'll have of me,
Not my horse nor my hound nor my fair lady."}

\verse{Then bold Sir Rylas the wild woman fell on,
\textit{All along and down alee.}
And bold Sir Rylas the wild woman fell on,
\textit{Down by the riverside.}
He split her head down to her chin,
You should have seen her kick and grin.}
