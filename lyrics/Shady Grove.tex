\chorus{Shady Grove, my little love,
Shady Grove I say,
Shady Grove, my little love,
I'm bound to go away.}

\verse{Cheeks as red a a blooming rose
And eyes are the prettiest brown.
She's the darling of my heart,
Sweetest girl in town.}

\verse{I wish I had a big fine horse
And corn to feed him on,
And Shady Grove to stay at home
And feed him while I'm gone.}

\verse{Went to see my Shady Grove,
She was standing in the door,
Her shoes and stockings in her hand,
And her little bare feet on the floor.}

\verse{When I was a little boy,
I wanted a Barlow knife,
And now I want little Shady Grove
To say she'll be my wife.}

\verse{A kiss from pretty little Shady Grove
Is sweet as brandy wine.
There ain't no girl in this old world
That's prettier than mine.}
