\chorus{Shady Grove, my little love,
Shady Grove I say,
Shady Grove, my little love,
I'm bound to go away.}

\verse{Cheeks as red a a blooming rose
And eyes are the prettiest brown.
She's the darling of my heart,
Sweetest girl in town.}

\verse{I wish I had a big fine horse
And corn to feed him on
And Shady Grove to stay at home
And feed him while I'm gone.}

\verse{Went to see my Shady Grove,
She was standing in the door
Her shoes and stockin's in her hand
And her little bare feet on the floor.}

\verse{When I was a little boy
I wanted a Barlow knife
And now I want little Shady Grove
To say she'll be my wife.}

\verse{A kiss form pretty little Shady Grove
Is sweet as brandy wine
There ain't no girl in this old world
That's prettier than mine.}
