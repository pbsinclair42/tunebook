\verse{Whaur hae ye bin sae lang lad?
Why hae ye got sae angry oh?
Whaur hae ye bin sae lang lad?
``I've bin waiting for the Orphir taxi oh".}
 
\chorus{And if ye had bin whaur I hae bin,
Ye'd ken why I was angry oh.
If ye had seen what I hae seen
On the wait for the Orphir taxi oh.}
 
\verse{The hour was one, the show was oer,
We cam oot o' the building oh,
And in the car park then began
Tae wait for the Orphir Taxi oh.}
 
\verse{Some tunes were played, some songs were sang,
The sky was getting lighter oh.
We called, said they ``It'll no be lang
`til we send ye all the Orphir Taxi oh".}

\verse{Noo three o'clock it cams and goes,
The phone calls got mair angry oh,
And through that nicht the cauld wind blows
On the wait for the Orphir Taxi oh.}
 
\verse{At half past three we saw a licht,
At last we'd spied a taxi oh,
But events were far fae oer that nicht,
In the saga of the Orphir Taxi oh.}

\verse{They've nae shame, they've nae shame,
They've sent a car fae Kirkwall oh,
And fifty pounds they then demand,
`cause they didnae send their ain firm's taxi oh.}
 
\verse{When she heard the news Le Mar arose
And stormed down tae the office oh,
To vent her fury and propose
Compensation for the Orphir Taxi oh.}
 
\verse{I've waited tae see my GP,
I've waited at the barber's oh,
But aw these waits are nought tae me
After waiting for the Orphir Taxi oh.}
